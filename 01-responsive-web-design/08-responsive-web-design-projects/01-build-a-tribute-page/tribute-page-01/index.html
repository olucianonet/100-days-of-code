            <strong>1830: </strong><strong>Luiz Gonzaga Pinto da Gama</strong> 
            born on June 21, in Salvador, Bahia.

            <strong>1840: </strong>He becomes captive and is sold by his own father.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1847: </strong>He begins his literacy process.
          </li>        
          <li>
            <strong>1848: </strong>Knowing to read and write, it obtains 
            irrefutable proofs of the illegality of its condition, since it was 
            the son of a free woman.
          </li>
          <li><strong>1848: </strong>Already free, serves as a soldier for 6 years.

            <strong>1849: </strong>He publishes his first work, <em>Primeiras Trovas
            Burlescas</em>, which placed him in the literary pantheon of Brazil only
            twelve years after he had learned to read.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1850: </strong>He married and tried to attend the Law Course of 
            Largo do São Francisco, because he was black, faced the hostility of
            teachers and students, but persisted as a listener. He did not finish 
            the course, but the acquired knowledge allowed him to act in the legal
            defense of black slaves.

          <li>
            <strong>1854: </strong>He leaves the corporation after being arrested

            journalist and collaborator of several progressive periodicals, 
            besides his performance in the courts, where according to some 
            estimates he was able to free approximately 1000 slaves. The causes
            were diverse, many involving blacks who could pay emancipation 
            letters, but were prevented by their masters from being released,
            or who had entered national territory after the slave trade 
            ban in 1850.
